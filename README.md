# borked-venvs

A simple tool to help find broken Python virtual environments. This is
really only useful and aimed at my macOS setup, where I use Homebrew,
`pyenv`, `pipenv` and generally keep virtual environments inside the
repository directory (but not inside the repository, I'm not a monster!).
There are rare occasions where I find all those tools get into a fight and I
end up with environments that no longer work due to broken symbolic links.
This helps me quickly check which repositories might be problematic.
